 ### A simple multiplayer shooter built with Melon.js and Node.js
 =========================== 

 ## Introduction
 Over one weekend, we (Helen Zeng, Timothy Strimple & Felix Rieseberg) 
 built a tiny multiplayer shooter that is completely browser-based and 
 powered by Node.js. We've used Melon.js, a bunch of Creative 
 Commons-licensed art and coded our way to a quick, easy and fun shooter
 for Node Knockout 2013.

 ## Using it
 This version has been cleaned up and made open-source for people who'd
 like to get a jumpstart on building a similar game. Feel free to use it to build
 your own game, but please understand that we used art found online, so please
 respect their individiual licenses.
