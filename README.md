### A simple multiplayer shooter built with Melon.js and Node.js

## Introduction
Over one weekend, we (Helen Zeng, Timothy Strimple & Felix Rieseberg) 
built a tiny multiplayer shooter that is completely browser-based and 
powered by Node.js. We've used Melon.js, a bunch of Creative 
Commons-licensed art and coded our way to a quick, easy and fun shooter
for Node Knockout 2013.

## Using it
This version has been cleaned up and made open-source for people who'd
like to get a jumpstart on building a similar game. Feel free to use it to build
your own game, but please understand that we used art found online, so please
respect their individiual licenses.
