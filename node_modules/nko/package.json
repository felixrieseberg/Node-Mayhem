  "readme": "node.js knockout deploy check-ins\n---------------------------------\n\nSo, we need to keep track of your deploys for lots of different reasons.\nBecause we want to be as platform-agnostic as possible, we now have this fancy\nmodule that will ping the competition website whenever you deploy.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nAdd `nko` to the dependencies section of your package.json:\n\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"nko\": \"*\",\n      \"other-awesome-stuff\": \"2.1.4\"\n    }\n\nAfter that, `npm install`.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nJust require it somewhere in your normal execution path. We recommend at the\ntop of your `server.js`:\n\n    require('nko')(secret);\n\nThe `secret` parameter is available on [your team page] (make sure you're\nsigned in to see it). It's tied to just your team, so don't share it with\nothers unless you want them hijacking your deploys.\n\nIf for whatever reason, you want to know when we've recorded the deploy, you\ncan pass an optional callback as the second parameter:\n\n    require('nko')('<your-team-secret>', function(err, res) {\n      if (err) throw err;\n      res.on('data', function(d) { console.log(d.toString()); });\n    });\n\n__Important: Not seeing your deploy count rise? Here's what to check:__\n\n* The module will only ping us if the `NODE_ENV` environment\n  variable is set to `production`.\n* We wait until your server has been __running for 5 seconds__ before sending\n  the deploy ping, so your server crashes before that, your deploy will not\n  get recorded.\n* We ensure that your server responds to a HTTP GET request on port 80 before\n  recording the deploy.\n* We ensure that the remote IP address from the ping matches the Joyent\n  instance we setup for your team. (So starting up your development machine\n  with `NODE_ENV=production` will not affect your deploy count.)\n\nProblems?\n=========\n\nAs always, you can contact us at [all@nodeknockout.com] or [@node_knockout].\nYou can also try checking the [issue tracker].\n\n[your team page]: http://nodeknockout.com/teams/mine\n[all@nodeknockout.com]: mailto:all@nodeknockout.com\n[@node_knockout]: http://twitter.com/node_knockout\n[issue tracker]: https://github.com/nko2/website/issues\n",
